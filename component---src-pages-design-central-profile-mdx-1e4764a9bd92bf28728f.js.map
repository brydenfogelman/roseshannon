Each product in the Wave Apps ecosystem asks the same profile questions over and over again. At Wave, we don't recognize the same user while they move through the ecosystem. We treat each customer as if it's their first time.\nIt's tedious and repetitive for the user and it causes us to have duplicative and redundant data. On the side of the product teams, this data is difficult to manage and hard to reconcile. It prevents us from having a smart system with context and personalization.`}</p>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <h2>{`Design Goal`}</h2>\n      <p>{`Onboarding is complicated. The products available at Wave can be overwhelming especially if you are a new user signing up for the first time. The best form of onboarding is like a white glove service, where you’re really holding your user’s hand letting them new features based on their needs and intentions. Onboarding is also not just one flow. It happens over the users' lifetime with the app and it happens continuously. How do we empower different product teams to input and own their on onboarding flows for their part of the product while still having a cohesive onboarding experience for Wave. How might this design solution serve as a single source of truth for the user and their information?`}</p>\n      <br />\n      <h2>{`Intended Outcome`}</h2>\n      <p>{`The outcome of the centralization program will be a `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{` scalable user profile and onboarding library `}</strong>{` that:`}</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`enables Product, Marketing, and Wave engineers,`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`supports risk, operations, and customer success specialists to deliver effortless, connected products and experiences to Wave customers.`}</li>\n      </ul>\n    </Section>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <Section title=\"Process\" mdxType=\"Section\">\n      <h2>{`Process`}</h2>\n      <p>{`I followed the double diamond product design process.
