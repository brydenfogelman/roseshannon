<Section title="Hello!" >

I started designing and building different digital products in 2018 as a way to spend my free time.

In my past experience as a Strategist, I have worked with clients to find the best way for them to bring new products and 
projects to life. Now I’m most interested in designing new products and applications, especially in the 
field of sustainability. 

My background is in perceptual psychology and I love using that to better understand and design for 
accessibility. I always want to work harder to make sure that anything I do or any project I’m a part 
of is inclusive and accessible to everyone.
