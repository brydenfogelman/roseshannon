<Section title="Overview">

## Summary
Lack of an invoice deposit/prepayment feature requires painful workarounds in order for BOs to keep their 
accounts receivable (A/R) and books accurate. If the cumbersome workflow is not followed, it can results in 
inaccurate books. If users create invoices for deposits only (for service in the future), their sales 
will be overstated.

<br />
<br />

## Design Goal
Enabling invoice prepayments empowers Wave Business Owners (BOs) to clearly indicate the deposit percentage, 
amount, due date, and terms on an invoice. Recording payments for a prepayment is seamless whether recording 
it manually, using Wave Payments or depositing a check via Wave Money. Wave automagically bookkeeps prepayment 
transactions, tracks customer credit balances, and keeps users informed of how these transactions impact their 
books and reports.

<Section title="Process">
I followed a standard Design Thinking approach to this project and split my project into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Contextual Analysis
Deposits/prepayments can be booked correctly if a user follows the correct laborious steps outlined in a Wave Help Centre article.
However, it requires painful workarounds and is not best best practice. There was opportunity to simplify this 
for Wave users and help ensure compliant bookkeeping of deposit/prepayment transactions.

## Workflows
**Deposit/Prepayments on an Existing Invoice**
- This is the current problem we are solving for. From the data, we know that 30% of existing invoices receive a 
partial payment.
- In the case, the invoice is dated in the future and the deposit payment is received before the invoice date.

**Customer Credit**
- This is the current problem we are solving for. From the data, we know that 30% of existing invoices receive a 
partial payment.
<br />
- This is currently solved for via the Accounting > Transactions page. The missing functionality is associating a 
deposit to a customer account in order to allow BOs to easily apply a deposit to an invoice.

## Creating an Invoice

The **Invoice Create** page needs to allow users the ability to create a deposit. From the perspective of the business owner, I want to be able to add
a deposit to my invoice and indicate to my customer the amount they need to pay and when the deposit is due. 

* As a BO, I want to add a deposit to my invoice 
* As a BO, I can indicate the desired deposit due date and deposit value (a percentage of the invoice total)
* The deposit due date picker follows the same pattern as the Invoice due components
<br />
<br />

We also want to give business owners the opportunity to save these deposit setting and apply them to all future invoice. I added the ability for these
default settings to be changed in Business Settings in the sidebar menu.

## Sending an Invoice
* Addition of the insights box at the top of the page which shows the user their **deposit amount, deposit due, invoice total, and invoice total due**
* Separated the dynamic amount owing for further clarification
* Copy revision of reminder scheduling to make it clear that reminders will be scheduled after the due dates for both the **deposit** and the **invoice due date**

## Viewing Invoice Status

As a business owner, I want to be able to follow the status of the invoice as I update the payments that I've received. 
I added the **Deposit Paid, Deposit Overdue, and Partial** invoice status that dynamic update as business owners update the invoice
with payments that they receive on an invoice from a customer.

## Design Principles

<Image src="designprinciples.png" />

When designing a new feature for Invoicing at Wave, which is such a core offering of the application, I needed to 
take the 6 design principles into account. Specifically for this project, deposits empower business owners to more accurately
bookkeep their invoices and sales. It is also a bespoke feature that is tailored to the needs that we have heard directly from our 
users. As the designer, I also tried to design a personable feature by repeating familiar patterns so that users could have a seamless
experience across the ecosystem.

<Section title="User Test">


## User Testing
I ran two cohorts for user testing. The first cohort included 10 participants and primarily tested the usability of the **adding a deposit** feature and the new value concepts on the sending an invoice flow. 

The second cohort included 5 participants. The second cohort primarily tested terminology and concept testing. The UX writer and I wanted to ensure that some of the specific terms that we were
introducing were as clear as possible. For that reason, we changed around **deposit due** to **deposit requested** and some other terms like this.

All user tests were analyzed in Dovetail and were used to inform design revisions prior to handoff to the engineering team.
