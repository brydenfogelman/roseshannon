## Summary
Lack of an invoice deposit/prepayment feature requires painful workarounds in order for BOs to keep their 
accounts receivable (A/R) and books accurate. If the cumbersome workflow is not followed, it can results in 
inaccurate books. If users create invoices for deposits only (for service in the future), their sales 
will be overstated.

<br />
<br />

## Design Goal
Enabling invoice prepayments empowers Wave Business Owners (BOs) to clearly indicate the deposit percentage, 
amount, due date, and terms on an invoice. Recording payments for a prepayment is seamless whether recording 
it manually, using Wave Payments or depositing a check via Wave Money. Wave automagically bookkeeps prepayment 
transactions, tracks customer credit balances, and keeps users informed of how these transactions impact their 
books and reports.

I followed a standard Design Thinking approach to this project and split my project into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Contextual Analysis
Deposits/prepayments can be booked correctly if a user follows the correct laborious steps outlined in a Wave Help Centre article.
However, it requires painful workarounds and is not best best practice. There was opportunity to simplify this 
for Wave users and help ensure compliant bookkeeping of deposit/prepayment transactions.

## Workflows
## 1. Deposit/Prepayments on an Existing Invoice
- This is the current problem we are solving for. From the data, we know that 30% of existing invoices receive a 
partial payment.
- In the case, the invoice is dated in the future and the deposit payment is received before the invoice date.

 <br />

**Payment workflows include:**
- Invoicing - Manual invoice payment
- Wave Payments
- Wave Money - Check Deposits
- Accounting Transactions

## 2. Customer Credit
- This is the current problem we are solving for. From the data, we know that 30% of existing invoices receive a 
partial payment.
<br />
- This is currently solved for via the Accounting > Transactions page. The missing functionality is associating a 
deposit to a customer account in order to allow BOs to easily apply a deposit to an invoice (without having to create 
separate account in the Chart of Accounts (CoAs) for each customer (which is not a good accounting practice).

## Creating an Invoice

The **Invoice Create** page needs to allow users the ability to create a deposit. From the perspective of the business owner, I want to be able to add
a deposit to my invoice and indicate to my customer the amount they need to pay and when the deposit is due. 

* As a BO, I want to add a deposit to my invoice. 
* As a BO, I can indicate the desired deposit due date and deposit value (a percentage of the invoice total)
* The deposit due date picker follows the same pattern as the Invoice due components

<br />

We also want to give business owners the opportunity to save these deposit setting and apply them to all future invoice. I added the ability for these
default settings to be changed in Business Settings in the sidebar menu.

## Sending an Invoice
The BO needs to 
* Addition of the insights box at the top of the page which shows the user their **deposit amount, deposit due, invoice total, and invoice total due**
* Separated the dynamic amount owing for further clarification
* Copy revision of reminder scheduling to make it clear that reminders will be scheduled after the due dates for both the **deposit** and the **invoice due date**
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Viewing an Invoice as a Customer
As a customer, I need to understand from a quick glance that I owe a deposit 
* Copy revision for greater clarification
* Addition of **deposit requested** and **deposit due**

## Viewing all Invoices
**User Story** - As a BO, I can see the Deposit amount due and the status for the applicable invoices. This is so that I know how much is owing per invoice.

## User Testing
I ran two cohorts for user testing. The first cohort included 10 participants and primarily tested the usability of the **adding a deposit** feature and the new value concepts on the sending an invoice flow. 

The second cohort included 5 participants. The second cohort primarily tested terminology and concept testing. The UX writer and I wanted to ensure that ...
