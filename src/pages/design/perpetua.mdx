## Summary
In the wake of the boom sustainable products and earth-conscious living, there has beena lack of monetary 
incentive for individuals to shop sustainably. Perpetua, a mobile banking and investment platform concept, 
incentivizes and rewards users to purchase sustainable products and invest in sustainable companies.


## Design Goal
It's becoming increasingly important to take action with your wallet to make an impact in climate change. 
The landscape on what products are considered sustainable and whether products are developed in a sustainable 
fashion is a confusing and manipulative one. I also really love mobile banking and especially now in the age of 
virtual-everything, an accessible and user-friendly banking experience is crucial. My task for this project concept 
was to design the end-to-end experience of a mobile banking and investment platform that would encourage and reward 
users for sustainable purchases. Right now, living a sustainable lifestyle is a privilege. Often products marketed 
as reusable, sustainable, Earth-conscious etc. come with a significant cost mark-up. The goal of this project 
was to develop an application that would monetarily incentivize users to put their money toward sustainable companies 
and products. I wanted users to be tangibly rewarded for spending their money in more sustainable ways and building 
sustainable habits. For US consumers, environmental impact ranked far behind price, brand, and perception of quality 
as a factor in consumer purchasing decisions.

# Contextual Analysis
While the response to climate change as been improving in the recent years, there still exists a gap between consumer perspectives on sustainable shopping and how they act with their wallet. 

Unilever estimates that almost 70% of its greenhouse gas footprint depends on which products customers choose and whether they use and dispose of them in a sustainable manner. - HBR, *The Elusive Green Consumer*

Consumers often have negative associations with sustainable product options, viewing them as being of lower quality, less aesthetically pleasing, and more expensive.

According to a survey conducted by Forbes, 93% of all surveyed participated indicated a general concern for the environment. While plastic pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change were deemed the top three issues, the respondents also indicated that they were ready to act on them, with 77% of individuals wanting to learn more about sustainable lifestyles. Data collected showed that most citizens had already taken steps to become more sustainable â€” 83% of them recycle, 57% use reusable bags and 45% avoid single-use plastics.
