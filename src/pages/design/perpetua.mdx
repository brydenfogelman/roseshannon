## Summary
In the wake of the boom sustainable products and earth-conscious living, there has beena lack of monetary
incentive for individuals to shop sustainably. Perpetua, a mobile banking and investment platform concept,
incentivizes and rewards users to purchase sustainable products and invest in sustainable companies.

## Design Goal
It's becoming increasingly important to take action with your wallet to make an impact in climate change.
The landscape on what products are considered sustainable and whether products are developed in a sustainable
fashion is a confusing and manipulative one. I also really love mobile banking and especially now in the age of
virtual-everything, an accessible and user-friendly banking experience is crucial. My task for this project concept
was to design the end-to-end experience of a mobile banking and investment platform that would encourage and reward
users for sustainable purchases. 

Right now, living a sustainable lifestyle is a privilege. Often products marketed
as reusable, sustainable, Earth-conscious etc. come with a significant cost mark-up. The goal of this project
was to develop an application that would monetarily incentivize users to put their money toward sustainable companies
and products. I wanted users to be tangibly rewarded for spending their money in more sustainable ways and building
sustainable habits. For US consumers, environmental impact ranked far behind price, brand, and perception of quality
as a factor in consumer purchasing decisions.

<Section title="Process">
I followed a standard Design Thinking approach to this project and split my project into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Contextual Analysis
While the response to climate change as been improving in the recent years, there still exists a gap between consumer 
perspectives on sustainable shopping and how they act with their wallet.
Unilever estimates that almost 70% of its greenhouse gas footprint depends on which products customers choose and whether 
they use and dispose of them in a sustainable manner. - HBR, *The Elusive Green Consumer*
Consumers often have negative associations with sustainable product options, viewing them as being of lower quality, less 
aesthetically pleasing, and more expensive.


According to a survey conducted by Forbes, 93% of all surveyed participated indicated a general concern for the environment. 
While plastic pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change were deemed the top 
three issues, the respondents also indicated that they were ready to act on them, with 77% of individuals wanting to learn 
more about sustainable lifestyles. Data collected showed that most citizens had already taken steps to become more 
sustainable — 83% of them recycle, 57% use reusable bags and 45% avoid single-use plastics.

When designing sustainable product alternatives, often the key to spreading sustainable consumer behaviors is to first break 
bad habits and then encourage good ones. Three subtle techniques can help shape positive habits: using prompts, providing feedback, and offering incentives. These techniques can be used to encourage and reinforce sustainable behaviours and will 
 be used in the design development of Perpetua.

## User Pain Points
The following are the core problems Perpetua aims to solve:

**Eco-friendly products are expensive** — Consumers are willing to pay more for green labelled or sustainable products.

**Companies are tempted to greenwash** — Companies are incentivized to market themselves as sustainable to appeal to a broader audience.

**Sustainable product alternatives are less popular** — Consumers often have negative associations with sustainable product options.

**Environmental impact is less off a priority when purchasing** — Other factors like price, brand, and perception of quality are more important than environmental impact when purchasing a product.

**Not incentivized to do more** — People feel they are already making an effort to be sustainable in their daily lives and finding it challenging to do more.

**The concern of sustainability extends beyond a single area** — Consumers worry about a wide range of environmental issues, not one single factor, like food packaging or marine litter.

## Problem Definition
There exists a gap in the sustainability product market in which consumers, willing to pay more for sustainable/future-forward products, are not incentivized to do.

## User Flows
What are important flows that need to be considered?


**Onboarding** - First off, we need to think about how a user might **initially set up their first account and sign in information**. This flow needs to have the user provide all of the necessary informtion required to open an account and verify their identity.
<Image src="Onboarding.png" />



**Activate Card** - Then, once a user has received their physical card, **how might they activate it in app**?

A user would need to be provided with a unique ID with their physical card sent to their address. The user would then confirm that ID in-app in order to activate their physical card.

**Transactions** - After making purchases, we can think about how a user would want to **interact with transactions and what information they would want to know**. Based off of user interviews, it is important for users to be able to view the time and date of transactions, the amount, and the vendor. For the purpose of rewards, each transaction would have a corresponding cash back percentage that the user received.

**Investing** - How might a user **set up an investment or high-interest savings account**? For investing, again a user would need to start with opening an account. However, we would then need to take them through a flow of determining what kind of account is right for them, determining their investment strategy based upon their risk score, and then determining their portfolio allocation. I decided to create a questionairre that helped align the portfolio allocation to the users'issues that most impact them.

## Wireframes
I focused on sketching out the onboarding flow and the flow for opening an investment account. I made sure the logic of these flows were sound before proceeding to final designs.

<Section title="Design">

## Moodboard
This was the first iteration of the moodboard that sparked the inspiration for the visual designs. I wanted to incorporate different shades of green with a black to white neutral colour palette for the text and data information. I really enjoyed these pops of orange, pastel pink, and red for highlights. 

Later in my design stages, the visual aesthetic became simpler with a palette solid colours, rather than the inclusion of gradients.

## Branding and Logo Development
I chose the name Perpetua for this project. I brainstormed names around sustainability, money, future, and other words in those fields. I liked the word perpetual in the way that it brought progress and a cyclical nature of work to my mind. 

The simplication of my design style for this project can be seen in the logo design.

## High Fidelity Mocks
**Onboarding Flow** - This flow would be how the user is initially introduced to the app. This shows 
how they choose an account and choose a card, learn about Perpetua's rewards and earnings, how sustainability is tied 
into every purchase, but also how Perpetua is built for everyday banking.

The biggest hurdle for this part was determining the Perpetua rewards tier hierarchy. Information is limited on what products are sustainable and what brands are more sustainable than others. I was able to confidently determine industries that are the most pollutant and should be disincentivized, however creating a 3% reward category for 'sustainable' purchases was difficult to standardize.

**Interact with Transactions**  - For these mocks, I based the initial home screen design off of my wireframe, but I needed to make sure that a user scrolling through their past transactions could easily click-into a single transaction and see more information. I thought it was important to include purchase information but also a way for the user to learn more about their rewards and why they had received x percent cash back on a certain purchase.

<Image src="Transactions_mock.png" />

**Rewards Redemption**  - A user can see their accumulated rewards, see from what purchases they received their cash back, and redeem their rewards. I wanted to give the user freedom in regard to where they can redeem their cash back -- whether it's into another account they have in the app or in any account they've linked. I added for the user to enter their 4-digit account PIN as an extra measure for security while they redeem their cash.

**Open an Investment Account**  - This begins with the user navigating to the Investments page and, similar to the User Flow, the user first selects what account is right for them and selects amongst investment accounts and high-interest savings accounts. 

For their risk tolerance, the user goes through a few questions that assesses their investment experience, their goals, and their intended timeline. They finally select what issues they want to fund with their investment money. Users select amongst a variety of sustainability related issues which will impact their portfolio allocation. Once they have confirmed this information, they are redirected to the Investment home screen.

**Activating Card** - I included the mocks for how a user would activate their physical card because I need to think about how I would make it clear for a user what information they needed, similar to the onboarding flow. For this process, the user needs to not only include a unique 8-digit ID on their physical card, but also the 4-digit PIN that they set when they created their account.
