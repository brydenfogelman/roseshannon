## Summary
Nearly one in four adults in the United states suffers with a mental illness. 
Not only have mental illnesses become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare and 
access to mental health support has been increasingly restricted. The global shortage of mental health 
workers has prompted the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots. Chatter, a mobile 
application focused on mental health wellness, offers users opportunity to interact with an artificial 
intelligence chatbot.

## Design Goal
Accessibility to mental health treatment and resources is limited and the prevalence of mental illness 
is only increasing. The treatment and recovery process of mental illness can be incredibly daunting. 
The complexity of the healthcare system, the expense of therapy, and many other hurdles can discourage 
individuals from seeking adequate care. My ask for this project concept was to design the end-to-end 
experience of a mobile mental wellness application that allows users to augment their treatment with 
interaction with a chatbot and curated CBT strategies. 

The treatment process of mental illness can be incredibly daunting, not only because of the 
complexity of mental illness itself, but also due to the hurdles that many individuals face when 
trying to find adequate care.

## Contextual Analysis
Mental illness is a growing public health concern worldwide. One in 4 adults and 1 in 10 children are 
likely to be affected by mental health problems annually. Mental illness has a significant impact on 
the lives of millions of people and a profound impact on the community and economy. Mental disorders 
impair quality of life and are considered one of the most common causes of disability. Mental disorders 
are predicted to cost $16 trillion globally between 2011 and 2030 due to lost labor and capital output.


There is a shortage of mental health human resources, poor funding, and mental health illiteracy 
globally. This lack of resources is especially evident in low-income and middle-income countries 
where there are 0.1 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 people, compared to 90 psychiatrists per 
1,000,000 people in high-income countries. The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted 
the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people with 
mental health conditions. Reviews conducted of relevant research has concluded that chatbots have 
the potential to improve mental health but are not sufficient in themselves as treatment for mental 
illness. Integration of artificial intelligence chatbots in mental health treatment have the 
potential to increase efficacy of treatment and reduce symptoms.

Two-thirds of the chatbots in this review used predefined rules and decision trees to generate their 
responses, while the remaining chatbots used artificial intelligence. In contrast to rule-based 
chatbots, artificial intelligence chatbots can generate responses to complicated queries and enable 
users to control the conversation [13]. Artificial intelligence chatbots can exhibit more empathetic 
behaviors and humanlike filler language than rule-based chatbots. 


OpenAI GPT-3 is a text generating neural network that was released in June 2020. GPT-3 has some 
advanced capabilities due to its context-based nature. Once a user puts in a request, or 'sends a 
message', the language analyses it and provides the most probable answer. The text predictor processes 
all of the text existing on the Internet, calculating the most statistically expected output. Most of 
the time, the outputs feel very similar to those written by a human.

## User Pain Points
The following are the core problems Chatter aims to solve:

**Therapists are limited and hard to find** — In developing countries, there are 0.1 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 people and 90 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 in developed countries. There is a global shortage of mental health resources which makes it difficult for individuals to reach help. 

**Time with therapists is short** — Given that mental health resources is limited, once a user may be connected with a therapist, time may feel limited to discuss mental health issues.

**Recommendations from GPs can feel generic** — Prior to connecting with a therapist, often individuals first address their mental health concerns with their general practitioner. the standard treatment plan of diet, exercise, sleep, etc can appear very generic to people who have been suffering from mental illness for an extended period of time. 

**Hard to find people to talk to** — While waiting for a therapist, it can be difficult for isolated individuals to reach out to people to talk to. Especially during the pandemic, people may feel isolated from their support networks, and it's important for people to be able to express themselves.

**Mental health applications are often expensive** — Applications targeted toward individuals seeking to improve their mental health seem to often have base apps that only provide simple strategies.

## Competitive Audit
1. **I am Zoe** - An application that offers users a chat interface and a simple interaction prompt. 
I am Zoe responds with open questions to get the user to rephrase or reflect on their feelings and 
experiences. This can be an extremely effective listening tool.  Beyond this interaction, Zoe does not 
provide educational, coping, or skill-developing tools for the user to grow on their own. Instead, I am 
Zoe is positioned as a one-dimensional chatting app with a very specific purpose: for users to elaborate 
on their own responses, with no leading or direction from the app itself. This is intended to help the 
user understand their feelings better and encourage self-reflection through elaboration.

2. **Wysa** - Wysa is anthropomorphic penguin that users can chat with. Wysa allows users to direct the 
conversation but also includes open listening similar to I am Zoe. Open questions with paraphrasing 
helps for the user to feel heard and be given the opportunity to expand on their thoughts. Wysa offers 
users the ability to get in touch with professional therapists and gain access to professional 
therapeutic exercises as well. These however, are accessible at a premium cost.

3. **Woebot** - Woebot is a health and wellness application that specifically focuses on mental health 
and self-care. Woebot offers a "self-care coach" with whom the user can chat at any time. The user 
is able to somewhat direct the conversation depending on their area of need, and Woebot 
compartmentalizes the user's progress into modules/tools that the user is able to look back upon 
whenever they so choose. Woebot is a great learning tool to better understand specific terminology 
and be introduced to basic habits of cognitive behavioural therapy. However, Woebot's primary chat 
interface is driven by the app itself, offers only pre-determined responses most of the time, and 
sets the user on defined conversation paths that seem to end pre-maturely.

## User Flows
What are important flows that need to be considered?


**Chat Onboarding** - The user needs to be introduced and onboarded to both the application and the chat. I thought being onboarded through a conversation with the chatbot was the best way for the user to get acquainted with the way the rest of the app would be navigated. So through the chatbot, the user learns of the purpose of the app, sets check-in reminders, enables notifications, and completes their anxiety/depression assessments.

**Strategies** - Then, once a user has received their physical card, **how might they activate it in app**?

A user would need to be provided with a unique ID with their physical card sent to their address. The user would then confirm that ID in-app in order to activate their physical card.

**Navigate to Strategies** - After making purchases, we can think about how a user would want to **interact with transactions and what information they would want to know**. Based off of user interviews, it is important for users to be able to view the time and date of transactions, the amount, and the vendor. For the purpose of rewards, each transaction would have a corresponding cash back percentage that the user received.

**Contacting a Professional** - How might a user **set up an investment or high-interest savings account**? For investing, again a user would need to start with opening an account. However, we would then need to take them through a flow of determining what kind of account is right for them, determining their investment strategy based upon their risk score, and then determining their portfolio allocation. I decided to create a questionairre that helped align the portfolio allocation to the users'issues that most impact them.

## Wireframes
I focused on sketching out the onboarding flow and the flow for opening an investment account. I made sure the logic of these flows were sound before proceeding to final designs.

## Moodboard
This was the first iteration of the moodboard that sparked the inspiration for the visual designs. 
As you will see, I went very far away from this moodboard. I ended up reiterating to better capture 
what I was going for - as you can see, I find a lot of inspiration from colours and illustration. I 
really like to go to Pinterest for this part of the project to just get inspired for what the project 
could look like when it comes to life.

## Branding and Logo Development
I chose the name Chatter for this project. When thinking of mental health, Chatter brings to 
mind this idea of mind-chatter. This endless cycle of thoughts that can permeate your life and 
make daily tasks feel unmanageable. In terms of a mental health chat-bot application, Chatter 
makes that connection between thoughts that can become all encompassing in mental illnesses and 
the ability to get those thoughts out through a chat. 

I went on a journey when it came to the logo design for Chatter. I started out very literal with a 
pair of chattering teeth, but as time went on, the logo became more refined and more aligned with the 
rest of the app branding.
