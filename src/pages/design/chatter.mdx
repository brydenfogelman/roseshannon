## Summary
Nearly one in four adults in the United states suffers with a mental illness. 
Not only have mental illnesses become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare and 
access to mental health support has been increasingly restricted. The global shortage of mental health 
workers has prompted the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots. Chatter, a mobile 
application focused on mental health wellness, offers users the opportunity to interact with an artificial 
intelligence chatbot.

<br />
<br />

## Design Goal
Accessibility to mental health treatment and resources is limited and the prevalence of mental illness 
is only increasing. The treatment and recovery process of mental illness can be incredibly daunting. 
The complexity of the healthcare system, the expense of therapy, and many other hurdles can discourage 
individuals from seeking adequate care. My ask for this project was to design the end-to-end 
experience of a mobile mental wellness application that allows users to augment their treatment with 
interaction with a chatbot and curated CBT strategies.

I followed a standard Design Thinking approach to this project and split my project into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Contextual Analysis
Mental illness is a growing public health concern worldwide. One in 4 adults and 1 in 10 children are 
likely to be affected by mental health problems annually. Mental illness has a significant impact on 
the lives of millions of people and a profound impact on the community and economy. Mental disorders 
impair quality of life and are considered one of the most common causes of disability. Mental disorders 
are predicted to cost $16 trillion globally between 2011 and 2030 due to lost labor and capital output.


There is a shortage of mental health human resources, poor funding, and mental health illiteracy 
globally. This lack of resources is especially evident in low-income and middle-income countries 
where there are 0.1 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 people, compared to 90 psychiatrists per 
1,000,000 people in high-income countries. The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted 
the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people with 
mental health conditions. Reviews conducted of relevant research has concluded that chatbots have 
the potential to improve mental health but are not sufficient in themselves as treatment for mental 
illness. Integration of artificial intelligence chatbots in mental health treatment have the 
potential to increase efficacy of treatment and reduce symptoms.

Two-thirds of the chatbots in this review used predefined rules and decision trees to generate their 
responses, while the remaining chatbots used artificial intelligence. In contrast to rule-based 
chatbots, artificial intelligence chatbots can generate responses to complicated queries and enable 
users to control the conversation [13]. Artificial intelligence chatbots can exhibit more empathetic 
behaviors and humanlike filler language than rule-based chatbots. 


OpenAI GPT-3 is a text generating neural network that was released in June 2020. GPT-3 has some 
advanced capabilities due to its context-based nature. Once a user puts in a request, or 'sends a 
message', the language analyses it and provides the most probable answer. The text predictor processes 
all of the text existing on the Internet, calculating the most statistically expected output. Most of 
the time, the outputs feel very similar to those written by a human.

## User Pain Points
The following are the core problems Chatter aims to solve:

**Therapists are limited and hard to find** — In developing countries, there are 0.1 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 people and 90 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 in developed countries. There is a global shortage of mental health resources which makes it difficult for individuals to reach help. 

**Time with therapists is short** — Given that mental health resources is limited, once a user may be connected with a therapist, time may feel limited to discuss mental health issues.

**Recommendations from GPs can feel generic** — Prior to connecting with a therapist, often individuals first address their mental health concerns with their general practitioner. the standard treatment plan of diet, exercise, sleep, etc can appear very generic to people who have been suffering from mental illness for an extended period of time. 

**Hard to find people to talk to** — While waiting for a therapist, it can be difficult for isolated individuals to reach out to people to talk to. Especially during the pandemic, people may feel isolated from their support networks, and it's important for people to be able to express themselves.

**Mental health applications are often expensive** — Applications targeted toward individuals seeking to improve their mental health seem to often have base apps that only provide simple strategies.

## Competitive Audit
1. **I am Zoe** - Offers users a chat interface and a simple interaction prompt. 
I am Zoe responds with open questions to get the user to rephrase or reflect on their feelings and 
experiences. This is intended to help the user understand their feelings better and encourage self-reflection through elaboration. 

Beyond this interaction, Zoe does not provide educational, coping, or skill-developing tools for the user to grow on their own. 
Instead, I am Zoe is positioned as a one-dimensional chatting app with a very specific purpose: for users to elaborate 
on their own responses, with no leading or direction from the app itself. 

2. **Wysa** - Wysa is anthropomorphic penguin that users can chat with. Wysa allows users to direct the 
conversation but also includes open listening similar to I am Zoe. Open questions with paraphrasing 
helps the user feel heard and expand on their thoughts. 

Wysa offers users the ability to get in touch with professional therapists and gain access to professional 
therapeutic exercises as well. These however, are accessible at a premium cost.

3. **Woebot** - Woebot is a health and wellness application that specifically focuses on mental health 
and self-care. Woebot offers a "self-care coach" with whom the user can chat at any time. The user 
is able to somewhat direct the conversation depending on their area of need, and Woebot 
compartmentalizes the user's progress into modules/tools that the user is able to look back upon 
whenever they so choose. 

Woebot is a great learning tool to better understand specific terminology 
and be introduced to basic habits of cognitive behavioural therapy. However, Woebot's primary chat 
interface is driven by the app itself, offers only pre-determined responses most of the time, and 
sets the user on defined conversation paths that seem to end pre-maturely.

## Problem Definition
There is a gap in the field of mental health and wellness mobile applications in which users could be 
connected with a chatbot, powered by natural language machine-learning models, to increase efficacy of treatment and to reduce symptoms of 
mental illness.

## User Flows
What are important flows that need to be considered?


**Chat Onboarding** - The user needs to be introduced and onboarded to both the application and the chat. I thought being onboarded through a conversation with the chatbot was the best way for the user to get acquainted with the way the rest of the application would be navigated. 

Through the chatbot, the user learns of the purpose of the app, sets check-in reminders, enables notifications, and completes their anxiety/depression assessments. 
<Image src="chat_onboarding.png" />



**Strategies** - There are a couple ways for the user to be introduced to Strategies. While they chat with the chatbot they are recommended a CBT strategy based on their responses and what exercises they have previously completed. Users can also navigate away from the chatbot and navigate to the Browse page. Here, they can search through all available Strategies on the app. However, regardless of how they arrive at a Strategy exercise, **Strategies are completed through the chat itself**. 

I did this because I wanted the chat function to be the center of the application. I wanted the user to be connected to the chat while they exercise and improve their coping strategies so that Chatter and the chatbot can feel like a valuable tool for them.

**Contacting a Professional** - Regardless of the efficacy of the Chatter application, there will be cases when users need outside help. I wanted it to be easy for users to be able to locate and contact professionals within the app. For this I thought it would be best if, in the Onboarding flow, the user linked their GP portal account. Then if they need to reach out to their doctor, they could easily click into their Profile and select their Doctor Portal to be redirected. 

In case a user wants to reach counselling, I designed the discovery of local counselling help by using geolocating withing the app. Users could then identify couselling or therapist services near them and contact them more easily.

I also designed an 'SOS' feature. Within the chat itself, if a user feels they need to send an 'SOS', the chatbot will contact their doctor through the Doctor Portal. This will notify the GP to get in touch with the user.

## Wireframes
I focused on sketching the main layouts of the Chat frames and the interactions that users would have with the Strategies from 
the Chat. This layout evolved as I went onto design the high-fidelity mockups because I wanted to integrate the Strategies into 
the Chat conversations more seamlessly. I intended to make the Strategy exercises more conversational rather than have them take 
the user to a different frame.

## Moodboard
On the left is the first iteration of the moodboard that sparked the inspiration for the visual designs. 
As you will see, I went very far away from this moodboard. I ended up reiterating to better capture 
what I was going for. I find a lot of inspiration from colours and illustration. I 
really like to go to Pinterest for this part of the project to just get inspired for what the project 
could look like when it comes to life. 

<Image src="chat_moodboard.png" />

## Branding and Logo Development
When thinking of mental health, the name Chatter brings to 
mind this idea of mind-chatter. I think of the endless cycle of thoughts that can permeate your life and 
make daily tasks feel unmanageable. In terms of a mental health chat-bot application, Chatter 
makes that connection between thoughts that can become all-encompassing in mental illnesses and 
the ability to get those thoughts out through a chat. 

I went on a journey when it came to the logo design for Chatter. I started out taking a literal approach with a 
pair of chattering teeth. As time went on, the logo became more refined and more aligned with the 
rest of the app branding.

## High Fidelity Mocks
**Chat Onboarding** - The user moves through the regular sign up process and also is notified of important information. As indicated in the Chat Onboarding User Flow, the purpose, process, and user expectations of Chatter are expressed to the user through the chat itself. The user is provided some predetermined responses to swiftly move through this initial section. 

After chat onboarding, the user is asked by the chatbot how they would like to start: with a **symptom assessment or with open chat**.

<Image src="chat_onboard 3.png" />
<Image src="chat_onboard 4.png" />

**Strategy Exercise** - Users complete Strategy exercises with guidance of the chatbot. This mock flow shows the user being recommended a visualization exercise and then completing a gratitude journaling exercise. The chatbot first recommends the visualization exercise, explains what the exercise is and how it works at the request of the user, but then suggests the gratitude journaling exercise when the user opts out of the visualization exercise. 

This flow shows how the user can interact with the chatbot to complete different exercises. A user can agree to or turn down the exercise suggestions. The mocks also show how the user navigates to the Visualization strategy page, be redirected to the Chat, and begin the exercise.


<Image src="chat_strategy.png" />
<Image src="viz_chat.png" />

**Navigating to Strategies** - Users are able to navigate away from the main Chat page, scroll through their Summary page, and navigate to Browse. They look through the available Strategy exercises on this page. 

<Image src="browse_strat.png" />

**Contacting a Professional** - From the main Chat page, users click-into their Profile on the top-right. They then access their Doctor Portal which will then either open the native application on their phone or open a browser window.

If the user chooses to search for resources, they select couselling services near them. A local, interactive map opens showing locations of clinic, therapist, and couselling services, with a list of these services underneath.

<Section title="Feedback">

## User Testing
Version 1 of Chatter had a much different design system which more closely resembled the wireframes. After conducting user testing, some of the feedback I received was:
- Not enough colours to differentiate across screens or indicate what is interactive
- It doesn't seem like the chat is the center of the app
- Pagination up at the top isn't a clear form of navigation

For Version 2 of Chatter, I redesign how Strategies were integrated with the application. Rather than having a dedicated Strategy 
page pop up when the user wanted to do an exercise, instead, the user would be redirected back to the chat. I also redesigned the 
colour palette and introduced more variation throughout the app to be more visually interesting. I also removed the pagination form of navigation
 and opted for a fixed menu and Profile icon. I agreed that pagination didn't achieve a clear way to navigate between the Chat, Profile, and Strategies.
