## Summary
Onboarding at Wave spans a lot of teams, so understandably the holistic user experience was clunky, repetitive, and disjointed. Each product in the Wave Apps ecosystem asks the same profile questions over and over again. At Wave, we don't recognize the same user while they move through the ecosystem. We treat each customer as if it's their first time.
It's tedious and repetitive for the user and it causes us to have duplicative and redundant data. On the side of the product teams, this data is difficult to manage and hard to reconcile. It prevents us from having a smart system with context and personalization.

<br />
<br />

## Design Goal
Onboarding is complicated. The products available at Wave can be overwhelming especially if you are a new user signing up for the first time. The best form of onboarding is like a white glove service, where you’re really holding your user’s hand letting them new features based on their needs and intentions. Onboarding is also not just one flow. It happens over the users' lifetime with the app and it happens continuously. How do we empower different product teams to input and own their on onboarding flows for their part of the product while still having a cohesive onboarding experience for Wave. How might this design solution serve as a single source of truth for the user and their information?
<br />

## Intended Outcome
The outcome of the centralization program will be a ** scalable user profile and onboarding library ** that:
* enables Product, Marketing, and Wave engineers,
* supports risk, operations, and customer success specialists to deliver effortless, connected products and experiences to Wave customers.

## Process

I followed the double diamond product design process. This project in particular, for Wave, was more 
situated in the Discovery and Definition phases. It required a lot of structuring, exploration, and planning for what 
was going to be a extensive and complex Design and Delivery process.

## Wave's Ecosystem of Products
Below is a visual representation of how Wave's products (Invoicing, Payments, Payroll, Accounting, Wave Money, Wave Advising) all relate to one another and interconnect via streams of data and/or money.

## Audit
How to build a modular onboarding process, I needed to first understand what the experience was currently like for the user. 
An audit is the basis for how we are going to build the toolkit and experience design. This works as an audit 
of the existing ecosystem. I reviewed each question Wave asks the user during each application flow. I created user flows and sorted these questions into categories for clarification.

## User Journey
When thinking about the impact that centralization will have on the Wave ecosystem and the experience design overall, we need to thinking 
about the user journey as it exists today.

<br />
<br />

## Information Architecture
Now think back to the audit...if we were to visualize the information from the audit modularly, it allows us to easily 
see the overlaps of information that users are asked in each onboarding flow.

The orange rectangles represent areas of overlap in the current information architecture. That's a huge problem for users. We can cut all of that repetition out and starting to build streamlined application flows. With this user data we can also configure a user profile.

## Modular, Flexible Onboarding
As I audited the existing onboarding experiences that were present throughout Wave, I began to categorize them, chunk them, and then organize them into bite-sized onboarding steps. These bite-sized steps are contained within a page, which are contained within flows, which are designed to get users to **see value and be prepared regarding a certain topic, without overwhelming them**.
<br />
I also leaned heavily into this idea of a flexible onboarding process. If a user starts onboarding at product A, how might that impact their onboarding of product B, or product C? So the onboarding experience can adapt given the user’s previous experience in Wave. 
<br />
<br />

What is beneficial about this modular model is that we can easily replace onboarding steps with others, or group them based on their product category. This allows for **tailored** onboarding flows specific to the customers' need and situation.

## Central Profile
The central user profile would be the hub for the user to manage, update, and edit their personal information that is acquired through each onboarding flow. They would also be able to see upcoming and past completed onboarding flows for the Wave ecosystem.

## Design Principles

<Image src="designprinciples.png" />

The design principles for product design at Wave guide every feature we create. Centralization heavily draws from the empowering, tailored, 
and contextual principles. The centralization intiative aims to empower users on their journey through the ecosystem by onboarding them to 
different parts of the app in a logical and contextual way. In doing so, we will be able to surface their user data in a contextual way and 
be transparent when the user needs to update or manage their own information.

## Onboarding Design System
Having a designated set of design components for onboarding steps offers a cohesive experience across all of Wave. It also sets up separate product teams for success when working individually since they can all turn to a single design system. 
These design system components will be the building blocks of the future onboarding flows and the user profile at Wave.

## Design Documentation
Along with the onboarding design system. I also created detailed design system documentation to help guide any future design or product team when they go to design a future onboarding flow. I also created templates and guiding principles for further clarification. This allows Wave onboarding to be scalable and tailored to future user needs.

## Wireframes

The first round of prototyping was to outline the order and structure of the user application flow for the Wave ecosystem. This was based off of the future 
state information architecture that detailed the user journey through the application flows for each Wave application. It identifies how user data acquisition throughout 
the application flows will be distributed across the various apps. 

The prototypes were developed from a mobile-first perspective because a huge initative at the time at Wave was to launch the new Wave mobile application.

## Prototypes

After receiving feedback from the team regarding these wireframes. I began developing prototypes to make the initial mobile onboarding experience
experience really come to life. These prototypes now feature the Wave brand-refresh, so they have a different look and feel than the previous wireframes.

## What's Next?

The Central Profile Initiative was unfortunately deprioritzed and descoped during my time at Wave. The initial steps to lay the engineering groundwork is 
starting in January 2022. My work thus far will be used a the template to move forward when the initiative is revisited in 2022-2023.
