<Section title="Overview">

## Summary
Each product in the Wave Apps ecosystem asks the same profile questions over and over again. At Wave, we don't 
recognize the same user while they move through the ecosystem. We treat each customer as if it's their first time. 
It's tedious and repetitive for the user and it causes us to have duplicative and redundant data. This data is difficult 
to manage and hard to reconcile. It prevents us from having a smart system with context and personalization.

<br />
<br />

## Design Goal
Centralizating how Wave captures user information and data into a 'user profile'. Along with this, we also intend 
to centralize how we expose data to the user and how we allow the user to change/update data. We need to develop a 
single source of truth for profile information and data.

## The Centralization Initiative

I followed the double diamond product design process. This project in particular, for Wave, was more 
situated in the Discovery and Definition phases. It required a lot of structuring, exploration, and planning for what 
was going to be a extensive and complex Design and Delivery process.

<Image src="discovery_cp.png" />



**Why is this important?** <br />
Centralization is a **process** -- moving from a distributed, unconnected, and repetitive assets and activities 
to a singular, central, consistent, and re-usable resources.

<br />

## Intended Outcome

The outcome of the centralization program will be a **scalable business platform** that:
* supports risk, operations, and customer success specialists, and
* enables Product, Marketing, and Wave engineers,
to deliver effortless, connected products and experiences to Wave customers.

## Audit
An audit is the basis for how we are going to build the toolkit and experience design. This works as an audit 
of the existing ecosystem.

<br />

## Wave Ecosystem
What does the Wave ecosystem look like in general and how does centralization fit in?
<br />
<br />
<Image src="wave-ecosystem.png" />

**What does success look like for the audit?** <br />
* Development of a modular hierarchy and how it corresponds to components in Bouyant 
* Development of a naming convention for the modular system
* Audit of the existing ecosystem of application/sign up flow



<br />
This is a general idea of what the ecosystem audit looks like. I reviewed each question Wave asks the 
user during each application flow. I created user flows and sorted these questions into categories for 
clarification. 
<br />

## Translating the Audit into Something Modular
So we have all of this information from looking at the onboarding flows and the existing user data. How do I translate 
these elements into a *modular* system. 

<Image src="modularsystem.png" />

<Image src="modularsystem2.png" />

These units will be the building blocks of the modular toolkit that will help us build the future of 
onboarding and the user profile at Wave. 


<br />
<br />

## Toolkit Development
<Image src="toolkit_cp.png" />

With the audit of the current state of the Wave ecosystem. I could then use the output of the audit to then start 
developing the modular components of the toolkit. The **final version of toolkit will be deduped and simplified**. 
It will serve as **the building blocks of the future onboarding flows and user profile**.

## Alright that looks complicated...
What's the next step? With these components (the middle column), we can combine them in a logical way to develop 'modular plugins'.

<Section title="Define">

## Toolkit Documentation
<Image src="toolkitdoc_cp.png" />
<br />

**What are modular plugins again?**
Modular plugins are combinations of components or plugins that will be able to be repeatable across the ecosystem. 
<br />


<Image src="modulartoolkit.png" />

We will use these elements to start to **redevelop the structure of application sign up and the central profile**.

<br />
<br />

## Experience Vision
<Image src="experience_cp.png" />
For the experience vision phase of the Centralization initiative, I needed to consider the wider user experience of the Wave ecosystem before jumping into redeveloping
the user application flows.
<br />
<br />
A huge goal of this initiative is to develop a centralized profile and a distributed system application flows. The central profile will house all user-related Information, but
all of that user data is acquired through a series of distributed applcation flows. 
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Design Principles

<Image src="designprinciples.png" />

The design principles for product design at Wave guide every feature we create. Centralization heavily draws from the empowering, tailored, 
and contextual principles. The centralization intiative aims to empower users on their journey through the ecosystem by onboarding them to 
different parts of the app in a logical and contextual way. In doing so, we will be able to surface their user data in a contextual way and 
be transparent when the user needs to update or manage their own information.
<br />
<br />

## User Journey
When thinking about the impact that centralization will have on the Wave ecosystem and the experience design overall, we need to thinking 
about the user journey as it exists today.

<br />
<br />

## Information Architecture
Now think back to the audit...if we were to visualize the information from the audit using the modular plugins, it allows us to **easily 
see the overlaps of information that users are asked in each onboarding flow**.

<Image src="iacurrentstate.png" />

**What will this lead to?** If you look at all of those orangey-red rectangles, you can see the repetition in the ecosystem. That's a huge problem for users.
<br />
Instead, we can cut all of that repetition out and starting to build streamlined application flows. With this user data we can also configure a central profile.

## Wireframes

The first round of prototyping was to outline the order and structure of the user application flow for the Wave ecosystem. This was based off of the future 
state information architecture that detailed the user journey through the application flows for each Wave application. It identifies how user data acquisition throughout 
the application flows will be distributed across the various apps. 

The prototypes were developed from a mobile-first perspective because a huge initative at the time at Wave was to launch the new Wave mobile application.

## Prototypes

After receiving feedback from the team regarding these wireframes. I began developing prototypes to make the concept of a centralized user application 
experience really come to life. These prototypes now feature the Wave brand-refresh, so they have a different look and feel than the previous wireframes.

## What's Next?

The Central Profile Initiative was unfortunately deprioritzed and descoped during my time at Wave HQ. The initial steps to lay the engineering groundwork is 
starting in January 2022. My work thus far will be used a the template to move forward when the initiative is revisited in 2022-2023.
