## Summary
Payments, Wave's highest revenue generating product, isn't available on Wave's current mobile offering. Approximately **80% of Wave's active paying businesses** are using Payments. This means that approximately 55,000 business owners using Wave are being underserved on mobile.

[See final prototype in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/fGYJ6NVfGNQOvwJEt88rHY/Argo-Payments3?page-id=10849%3A132333&node-id=10850%3A133121&viewport=4392%2C573%2C0.23&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=10850%3A132748)<br />

## Design Goal
The goal for this project is decide which elements of the existing Payments product to pursue and/or how to evolve concepts to best meet business owners' needs on mobile.

<Section title="Process">


I followed the double diamond product design process and split my process into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Introduction
Designing and developing the **unified mobile app** (code name: ARGO) was a key initiative for Wave in the fiscal year of 22 and 23. The initiative involved the development of *a new, single app that enables our best fit customers to get their jobs to be done completed on mobile*.

## User Research
Before designing a mobile experience of Wave's Payments product, I needed to answer a few key research questions to better understand the user needs of the business owners I would be designing for. We conducted research in order to inform our holistic understanding of where, when, and why mobile apps are used in our target users' business practices. My key research questions and insights are as follows:

## What is the current user experience of Payments with Wave?
Wave users currently receive **payments** from their customers which arrive to their Wave account. Wave then releases these funds daily via **payouts** which arrive to the Wave users' bank account that they have previously connected to their Wave account.

## Initial Proposed Solution
The initial solution that I proposed to integrate the Payments product to the mobile offering, was to have all of the Payments features be dedicated to one Payments tab in the bottom navigation. Within this Payments tab, there would be further navigation between Payments and Payouts. This solution closely emulated the existing experience on the web and it neatly divided the two types of money transfers. 
<br />
<br />

After initial concept testing with users and receiving design feedback, we recognized that there were issues that needed to be addressed with this approach. 
<br />
The sub-navigation using the tabs within the bottom navigation was causing confusion. We noticed that the overall structure was pulling a lot of inspiration from the web experiene and we wanted to tested our assumption if we needed to continue with that approach.

<br />
<br />

## Sitemap Revision
I took a look at the information architecture of the Payments tab on mobile to see I could reduce some of the horizontal navigation. I found that by introducing a **unifying Payments and Payouts dashboard** I was able to reduce a lot of confusing navigation, visual clutter, and could overall make the user experience simpler.

## Design Principles

The design principles for product design at Wave guide every feature we create. The design of the mobile Payments flows heavily draws from the **empowering, personable, 
and transparent principles**. When offering Payments, we want the user to feel empowered to achieve their business goals, but we also want to provide them with familiar flows that appear elsewhere in the application. That is why the payments user flows share a lot of similarity to the invoice payment flows. Users also need to understand the breakdown of their payments and we, as designers, need to clearly and transparently lay out all of that information.

##Dashboard

I decided to implement an all-in-one money dashboard. This allows the user to have a single view for their Payments and Payouts, all in the same place. We simplified the visual detail necessary to convey each unit of information so that the Payments dashboard felt easily navigable without being overwhelming.

    <source src={argopaymentsnew} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<br />

In this prototype, you can see the design of a few other user flows that were involved in this project that were required to bring the Payments product to mobile. These included:
* Viewing a payment detail page
* Viewing a payout detail page
* Sending a receipt
* Signing up for instant payouts and processing an instant payout

<br />
<br />

##Initial Solution vs. Dashboard

I went through three iterations over the course of 4 months. I refined the Payments and Payouts dashboard design from and initial version based off of user feedback and team critique that I received.

## Design Review

I conducted a 30% finished design review with the Product Design team at Wave. I wanted feedback on high-level structure. Design reviews within the design team are a really fantastic way to get quick feedback on questions relating to interaction and components, especially when bringing in team members working on features that you're less familiar with. 

I also conducted a separate design review with my supervising Product Manager and the engineers that are on the Payments team at Wave. Together, we discussed the impact on scope that certain design decisions would have and the feasibility of specific interactions. 

<br />
<br />

## Usability Testing

Due to constrained development timelines, the team's ability to user test the Payments and Payouts flows with users of Wave and the general public is limited. We were instead able to user test these flows with internal users that have access to the alpha test of the unified mobile app. The usability testing we devised involved the following:

We are currently testing with internal Wave users and will iterate on design to accomodate user feedback prior to Alpha launch in June.
