## Summary
The architecture and design of Wave's Payments on mobile is a high priority because Wave's Payments product represents a huge revenue source for the company. Wave has approximately 69K active **paying** business, of which 80% use the Payments product. As Wave's product teams worked toward a new, unified mobile app, the strategy to transport Payments to mobile was of upmost importance.

## Design Goal
The goal for Payments on mobile was to decide which features of Payments to pursue and/or how to evolve concepts to best meet business owners' needs.

<Section title="Process">


I followed the double diamond product design process and split my process into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Introduction
Designing and developing the **unified mobile app** (code name: ARGO) was a key initiative for Wave in the fiscal year of 22 and 23. The initiative involved the development of *a new, single app that enables our best fit customers to get their jobs to be done completed on mobile*.

<br />

The North Star for the mobile experience is to deliver an integrated, world-class mobile product, in service of Wave's strategic outcome to deliver on the Wave ecosystem.

## Persona
Who are we talking about when we say our 'target user' for the unified mobile app? 

<Image src="SIB.png" />

<br />
<br />

## Mobile Context of Use
We conducted research in order to inform our holistic understanding of **where, when, and why mobile apps are used in our target users' business practices**.

<br />

## Payments
Beyond understanding how the SIBs use their mobile device to meet the needs of their business practice, we needed to specifically understand how their **payments-related needs** change when moving across platforms.

## Mobile Site Map
I developed a site map for the Payments section of the Wave mobile app (ARGO) so that the mobile team to have greater clarity when discussing the design of certain features, how they connect and relate to one another, and what screens are prioritized for V1. 
<br />
<br />
<Image src="argo-sitemap.png" />

Specifically looking at the portion of the mobile site-map dedicated to Payments, what we can see is that payments is made up of two main screens: **Payments + Payouts**. 
<Image src="psitemap.png" />

The details of the initial design of Payments and Payouts involve similar features. Primarily, users need to be able to **view the status past payments, take quick, vital actions related to payments and pay themselves quickly through instant payouts**. These design choices directly map back to the user research insights that we ascertained through the user interviews.

<br />

## Design Principles

The design principles for product design at Wave guide every feature we create. {{{Centralization heavily draws from the empowering, tailored, 
and contextual principles. The centralization intiative aims to empower users on their journey through the ecosystem by onboarding them to 
different parts of the app in a logical and contextual way. In doing so, we will be able to surface their user data in a contextual way and 
be transparent when the user needs to update or manage their own information.}}}

## Payments

The alpha launch of the unified mobile app will only feature a status page for the user to indicate to them their progress through the Payments onboarding. The Payments team decided to keep the Payments tab in the bottom navigation for increased discovery of the Payments product, as well as allowing users easier accessibility to Instant Payouts. If a user has successfully completed Payments onboarding, the value proposition within the Payments bottom navigation is within Payouts. However, if the user hasn't completed Payments onboarding, they'll be given the opportunity to start where they left off, or start the onboarding process from the beginning.

    <source src={status} type="video/mp4" />
</video>


<br />

<br />

Post V1, the design of the Payments flow required the development of a lot of unique components, shown below. These components interact together to create complex flows including:
* Processing a refund on a payment
* Deleting a payment
* Sending a receipt on a payment
* Editing a payment details
* Filtering or sorting the payment list

<br />
<video controls="false" style="width: 100%;" autoplay loop >    
    <source src={payments} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Payouts
The prototyped flows show the user flow for Instant Payouts. This flow shows the following features:
* Onboarding for Instant Payouts
* Adding a debit card and bank account
* Adjusting an Instant Payout amount
* Doing an Instant Payout
* A successful and an unsuccessful Instant Payout

<br />
<br />

The design of these features were based off of the initial user research we conducted and therefore we prioritized the ability for users to 1. View their Instant Payout availability, 2. Onboard for Instant Payouts, and 3. Process an Instant Payout to their debit card. 
<br />


<video controls="false" style="width: 100%;" autoplay loop >
    <source src={payouts} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<br />
<br />

Following the Alpha launch of the unified mobile app, the next design priority is the **Payout List** and **Payout Detail View**. I prototyped the user flow to show the proposed user interaction with those components and screens. 

<br />

<br />
<br />

## Payments Onboarding
The Payments onboarding process overall is quick enough for the user to get excited about the Payments features, yet effective in acquiring adequate user information to ensure user security. The user is able to begin Payments onboarding when they first sign up for the Wave application. They can abandon onboarding at any point, and they will have the opportunity to come back to the onboarding process while having their progress saved.

## Design Review

I conducted a 30% finished design review with the Product Design team at Wave. I wanted feedback on high-level structure. Design reviews within the design team are a really fantastic way to get quick feedback on questions relating to interaction and components, especially when bringing in team members working on features that you're less familiar with. 

I also conducted a separate design review with my supervising Product Manager and the engineers that are on the Payments team at Wave. Together, we discussed the impact on scope that certain design decisions would have and the feasibility of specific interactions. 

<br />
<br />

## Usability Testing

Due to constrained development timelines, the team's ability to user test the Payments and Payouts flows with users of Wave and the general public is limited. We were instead able to user test these flows with internal users that have access to the alpha test of the unified mobile app. The usability testing we devised involved the following:

<br />

We are currently testing with internal Wave users and will iterate on design to accomodate user feedback prior to Alpha launch in June.
