## Summary
The architecture and design of Wave's Payments on mobile is a high priority because Wave's Payments product represents a huge revenue source for the company. Wave has approximately 69K active **paying** business, of which 80% use the Payments product. As Wave's product teams worked toward a new, unified mobile app, the strategy to transport Payments to mobile was of upmost importance.

## Design Goal
The goal for Payments on mobile was to decide which features of Payments to pursue and/or how to evolve concepts to best meet business owners' needs.

I followed the double diamond product design process and split my process into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.

## Introduction
Designing and developing the **unified mobile app** (code name: ARGO) was a key initiative for Wave in the fiscal year of 22 and 23. The initiative involved the development of *a new, single app that enables our best fit customers to get their jobs to be done completed on mobile*.

<br />

The North Star for the mobile experience is to deliver an integrated, world-class mobile product, in service of Wave's strategic outcome to deliver on the Wave ecosystem.

## Persona
Who are we talking about when we say our 'target user' for the unified mobile app?

<br />
<br />

## Mobile Context of Use
We conducted research in order to inform our holistic understanding of **where, when, and why mobile apps are used in our target users' business practices**.

<br />

## Payments
Beyond understanding how the SIBs use their mobile device to meet the needs of their business practice, we needed to specifically understand how their **payments-related needs** change when moving across platforms.

## Mobile Site Map
I developed a site map for the Payments section of the Wave mobile app (ARGO) so that the mobile team to have greater clarity when discussing the design of certain features, how they connect and relate to one another, and what screens are prioritized for V1. 
<br />
<br />
<Image src="argo-sitemap.png" />

Specifically looking at the portion of the mobile site-map dedicated to Payments, what we can see is that payments is made up of two main screens: **Payments + Payouts**. 
<Image src="psitemap.png" />

The details of the initial design of Payments and Payouts involve similar features. Primarily, users need to be able to **view the status past payments, take quick, vital actions related to payments and pay themselves quickly through instant payouts**. These design choices directly map back to the user research insights that we ascertained through the user interviews.

## Design Principles

The design principles for product design at Wave guide every feature we create. {{{Centralization heavily draws from the empowering, tailored, 
and contextual principles. The centralization intiative aims to empower users on their journey through the ecosystem by onboarding them to 
different parts of the app in a logical and contextual way. In doing so, we will be able to surface their user data in a contextual way and 
be transparent when the user needs to update or manage their own information.}}}

## Prototypes

</video>

After receiving feedback from the team regarding these wireframes. I began developing prototypes to make the concept of a centralized user application 
experience really come to life. These prototypes now feature the Wave brand-refresh, so they have a different look and feel than the previous wireframes.    

<br />
<br />

## Payments

The first round of prototyping was to outline the order and structure of the user application flow for the Wave ecosystem. This was based off of the future 
state information architecture that detailed the user journey through the application flows for each Wave application. It identifies how user data acquisition throughout 
the application flows will be distributed across the various apps. 

The prototypes were developed from a mobile-first perspective because a huge initative at the time at Wave was to launch the new Wave mobile application.

## Design Review

I conducted a 30% finished design review with the Product Design team at Wave. I wanted feedback on high-level structure. Design reviews within the design team are a really fantastic way to get quick feedback on questions relating to interaction and components, especially when bringing in team members working on features that you're less familiar with. 

I also conducted a separate design review with my supervising Product Manager and the engineers that are on the Payments team at Wave. Together, we discussed the impact on scope that certain design decisions would have and the feasibility of specific interactions. 

<br />
<br />

## Usability Testing

Due to constrained development timelines, the team's ability to user test the Payments and Payouts flows with users of Wave and the general public is limited. We were instead able to user test these flows with internal users that have access to the alpha test of the unified mobile app. The usability testing we devised involved the following:

We are currently testing with internal Wave users and will iterate on design to accomodate user feedback prior to Alpha launch in June.
