<Section title="Ecosystem Maps">

## End to End Journeys
These three Ecosystem Maps show both the ecosystem of the client [redacted information] across the marketing funnel, along with the comparison between the points of contact for a customer with client's owned channels and their 3rd party external channels. Our team worked very closely with this client, through multiple iterations, in order to best capture how their department envisaged the ecosystem. We did this for both technologies that this client provided, VR and AR, which indicates slightly different end-to-end journeys.

## Language
For this client, we wanted to articulate to them how they speak about themselves across their digital platforms. This ecosystem map shows each of their digital platforms and their associated points of contact with their audience. From each of these points of contact, we pulled a snippet of language to show them that their language and branding is inconsistent across their ecosystem.

<Section title="User Journeys">

This is a simplified user journey that I developed to articulate the needs of the user and to show the ups and downs of the user across the marketing funnel. The user's mood oscillates between their pain points and their needs.

<br />

This user journey shows two journeys of two different personas, as shown by the purple and green figures. What is meant to be articulated here is the shared high and low points across the retail journey for these two personas. Below this journey, we have needs categorized by shared needs and needs per each persona.

<Section title="Comparison Charts">

This comparison chart was designed as a way to quickly scan the differences between multiple stores on the lefthand rows, across multiple metrics in the columns. I used Harvey Balls as a visual way to indicate the rating system.

<br />

I designed this to again show how companies differ across various metrics, but also how they compare to one another. This is a simple and visual way to distinguish one company from another and see how they rank across each of the metrics.

<Section title="Timelines + Spectrums">

Timelines and spectrums are my favourite. This timeline shows the boom of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS price, all overlayed onto the 'Hype Cycle'. We wanted to show our client that the hype cycle aligns well with the trend of blockchain coin prices and aligns with notable events in the clients' company's history.

<br />

Using language analysis, I counted the frequency of words spoken in the stakeholder interviews that we had conducted for a client project. I then grouped these common words into themes mapped these words and themes across the spectrum of why/how/what.
