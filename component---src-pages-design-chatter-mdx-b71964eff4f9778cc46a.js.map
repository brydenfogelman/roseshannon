The treatment and recovery process of mental illness can be incredibly daunting.\nThe complexity of the healthcare system, the expense of therapy, and many other hurdles can discourage\nindividuals from seeking adequate care. My ask for this project concept was to design the end-to-end\nexperience of a mobile mental wellness application that allows users to augment their treatment with\ninteraction with a chatbot and curated CBT strategies. `}</p>\n      <p>{`The treatment process of mental illness can be incredibly daunting, not only because of the\ncomplexity of mental illness itself, but also due to the hurdles that many individuals face when\ntrying to find adequate care.`}</p>\n    </Section>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <Section title=\"Process\" mdxType=\"Section\">\nI followed a standard Design Thinking approach to this project and split my project into 4 phases: Discovery, Definition, Design, and Delivery.\n      <Image src=\"chatter_process.png\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n    </Section>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <Section title=\"Discovery\" mdxType=\"Section\">\n      <h2>{`Contextual Analysis`}</h2>\n      <p>{`Mental illness is a growing public health concern worldwide. One in 4 adults and 1 in 10 children are\nlikely to be affected by mental health problems annually. Mental illness has a significant impact on\nthe lives of millions of people and a profound impact on the community and economy. Mental disorders\nimpair quality of life and are considered one of the most common causes of disability. Mental disorders\nare predicted to cost $16 trillion globally between 2011 and 2030 due to lost labor and capital output.`}</p>\n      <p>{`There is a shortage of mental health human resources, poor funding, and mental health illiteracy\nglobally. This lack of resources is especially evident in low-income and middle-income countries\nwhere there are 0.1 psychiatrists per 1,000,000 people, compared to 90 psychiatrists per\n1,000,000 people in high-income countries. The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted\nthe utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people with\nmental health conditions. Reviews conducted of relevant research has concluded that chatbots have\nthe potential to improve mental health but are not sufficient in themselves as treatment for mental\nillness. Integration of artificial intelligence chatbots in mental health treatment have the\npotential to increase efficacy of treatment and reduce symptoms.`}</p>\n      <Image src=\"contextual_fig_chat.png\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n      <p>{`Two-thirds of the chatbots in this review used predefined rules and decision trees to generate their\nresponses, while the remaining chatbots used artificial intelligence. In contrast to rule-based\nchatbots, artificial intelligence chatbots can generate responses to complicated queries and enable\nusers to control the conversation `}{`[13]`}{`. Artificial intelligence chatbots can exhibit more empathetic\nbehaviors and humanlike filler language than rule-based chatbots. `}</p>\n      <p>{`OpenAI GPT-3 is a text generating neural network that was released in June 2020. GPT-3 has some\nadvanced capabilities due to its context-based nature. Once a user puts in a request, or 'sends a\nmessage', the language analyses it and provides the most probable answer. The text predictor processes\nall of the text existing on the Internet, calculating the most statistically expected output.

There is a global shortage of mental health resources which makes it difficult for individuals to reach help. `}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Time with therapists is short`}</strong>{` — Given that mental health resources is limited, once a user may be connected with a therapist, time may feel limited to discuss mental health issues.`}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Recommendations from GPs can feel generic`}</strong>{` — Prior to connecting with a therapist, often individuals first address their mental health concerns with their general practitioner. the standard treatment plan of diet, exercise, sleep, etc can appear very generic to people who have been suffering from mental illness for an extended period of time. `}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Hard to find people to talk to`}</strong>{` — While waiting for a therapist, it can be difficult for isolated individuals to reach out to people to talk to. Especially during the pandemic, people may feel isolated from their support networks, and it's important for people to be able to express themselves.`}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Mental health applications are often expensive`}</strong>{` — Applications targeted toward individuals seeking to improve their mental health seem to often have base apps that only provide simple strategies.  `}</p>\n      <br />\n      <h2>{`Competitive Audit`}</h2>\n      <ol>\n        <li parentName=\"ol\">\n          <p parentName=\"li\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`I am Zoe`}</strong>{` - An application that offers users a chat interface and a simple interaction prompt.\nI am Zoe responds with open questions to get the user to rephrase or reflect on their feelings and\nexperiences. This can be an extremely effective listening tool.  Beyond this interaction, Zoe does not\nprovide educational, coping, or skill-developing tools for the user to grow on their own. Instead, I am\nZoe is positioned as a one-dimensional chatting app with a very specific purpose: for users to elaborate\non their own responses, with no leading or direction from the app itself. This is intended to help the\nuser understand their feelings better and encourage self-reflection through elaboration.`}</p>\n        </li>\n        <li parentName=\"ol\">\n          <p parentName=\"li\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Wysa`}</strong>{` - Wysa is anthropomorphic penguin that users can chat with. Wysa allows users to direct the\nconversation but also includes open listening similar to I am Zoe. Open questions with paraphrasing\nhelps for the user to feel heard and be given the opportunity to expand on their thoughts. Wysa offers\nusers the ability to get in touch with professional therapists and gain access to professional\ntherapeutic exercises as well.

Woebot offers a \"self-care coach\" with whom the user can chat at any time. The user\nis able to somewhat direct the conversation depending on their area of need, and Woebot\ncompartmentalizes the user's progress into modules/tools that the user is able to look back upon\nwhenever they so choose. Woebot is a great learning tool to better understand specific terminology\nand be introduced to basic habits of cognitive behavioural therapy. However, Woebot's primary chat\ninterface is driven by the app itself, offers only pre-determined responses most of the time, and\nsets the user on defined conversation paths that seem to end pre-maturely.`}</p>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </Section>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <Section title=\"Definition\" mdxType=\"Section\">\n      <h2>{`Problem Definition`}</h2>\n      <p>{`There is a gap in the field of mental health and wellness mobile applications in which users could be\nconnected with a chatbot, powered by GTP-3, to increase efficacy of treatment and to reduce symptoms of\nmental illness. `}</p>\n      <br />\n      <h2>{`Personas`}</h2>\n      <Image src=\"personas_chat.png\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n      <h2>{`Use Cases`}</h2>\n      <Image src=\"Use Cases.png\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n      <br />\n      <h2>{`Executive Summary`}</h2>\n      <p>{`Chatter provides a mental wellness mobile application on which users can interact with an\nartificial intelligence chatbot, discuss their mental health conditions and receive suggested\ntreatment based in CBT.`}</p>\n    </Section>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <Section title=\"Ideation\" mdxType=\"Section\">\n      <h2>{`User Flows`}</h2>\n      <p>{`What are important flows that need to be considered?`}</p>\n      <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Chat Onboarding`}</strong>{` - The user needs to be introduced and onboarded to both the application and the chat.
