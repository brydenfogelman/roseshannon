Within this Payments tab, there would be further navigation between Payments and Payouts. This solution closely emulated the existing experience on the web and it neatly divided the two types of money transfers. `}</p>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <Image src=\"initialsolution.png\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n      <p>{`After initial concept testing with users and receiving design feedback, we recognized that there were issues that needed to be addressed with this approach. `}</p>\n      <br />\nThe sub-navigation using the tabs within the bottom navigation was causing confusion.

The design of the mobile Payments flows heavily draws from the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`empowering, personable,\nand transparent principles`}</strong>{`. When offering Payments, we want the user to feel empowered to achieve their business goals, but we also want to provide them with familiar flows that appear elsewhere in the application. That is why the payments user flows share a lot of similarity to the invoice payment flows. Users also need to understand the breakdown of their payments and we, as designers, need to clearly and transparently lay out all of that information. `}</p>\n      <Image src=\"designprinciples.png\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n    </Section>\n    <Section title=\"Design\" mdxType=\"Section\">\n      <p>{`##Dashboard`}</p>\n      <p>{`I decided to implement an all-in-one money dashboard.
